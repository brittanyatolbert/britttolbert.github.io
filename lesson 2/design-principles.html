            <h1>Repetition</h1>
            <h2>Netflix</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a>
                <h2>
                    <img src="image/IMG_1924.jpg" alt="Netflix">
                    <p>Netflix is a great example of the principle repetition in design. Repetition is represented in
                        colors, shapes, and typography. You will notice that all of the text, except for the logo, is in
                        white. They use one typeface but use different fonts such as bold. <br>
                        White, red, and black are the
                        main colors used.It is interesting to notice the repetition of the rectangle. It is visible in
                        the sign in button, the email address, buttons, and even the examples of the shows in the back
                        are organized rectangles. </p>

            <h1>White Space</h1>
            <h2>Roolee</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://roolee.com/">Roolee</a>
                <h2>
                    <img src="image/IMG_1922.jpg" alt="Roolee">
                    <p>Roolee uses great white space througout their website. This creates a clean, simple, and
                        navigational site. There is plenty of space between icons on the navigation bar. There is also
                        equal white space around the website name. It also frames the picture very well. <br> 
                        You will even
                        notive the white space used in their icons and contact bubbles. The white psace breaks up the
                        page into sections and adds to the overall design of the site.</p>

            <h1>Contrast</h1>
            <h2>Apple</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://apple.com/">Apple</a>
                <h2>
                    <img src="image/IMG_1923.png" alt="apple">
                    <p>Apple uses bold colors, type, and photography for contrast on their websites. The first thing you
                        notice are the contrasting black and white colors used. Threre is also the bright blue text with
                        the websites "call to action" letting the customer know what to do. <br>
                        The photo used is very colse
                        and in depth drawing you in. The colors used in ht epicture are similar to the website theme of
                        dark and light. </p>
