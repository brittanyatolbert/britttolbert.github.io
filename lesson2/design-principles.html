            <h3>repetition</h3>
            <h4>NETFLIX</h4>
            <h5><a href="https://www.netflix.com">(netflix.com)</a></h5>
                    <img src="image/IMG_1924.jpg" alt="Netflix" class=center>
                    <p>Netflix is a great example of the principle repetition in design. Repetition is represented in
                        colors, shapes, and typography. You will notice that all of the text, except for the logo, is in
                        white. They use one typeface but use different fonts such as bold. White, red, and black
                        are the
                        main colors used. It is interesting to notice the repetition of the rectangle. It is visible in
                        the sign in button, the email address, buttons, and even the examples of the shows in the back
                        are organized rectangles. </p>

            <h3>white space</h3>
            <h4>ROOLEE</h4>
            <h5><a href="https://roolee.com/">(roolee.com)</a></h5>
                    <img src="image/IMG_1922.jpg" alt="Roolee" class=center>
                    <p>Roolee uses great white space throughout their website. This creates a clean, simple, and
                        navigational site. There is plenty of space between icons on the navigation bar. There is also
                        equal white space around the website name. It also frames the picture very well. You will
                        even
                        notice the white space used in their icons and contact bubbles. The white space breaks up the
                        page into sections and adds to the overall aesthetic of the site.</p>

            <h3>contrast</h3>
            <h4>APPLE</h2>
            <h5><a href="https://apple.com/">(apple.com)</a></h5>
                    <img src="image/IMG_1923.png" alt="apple" class=center>
                    <p>Apple uses bold colors, type, and photography for contrast on their websites. The first thing you
                        notice are the contrasting black and white colors used. Threre isalso the bright blue text with
                        the websites "call to action" letting the customer know what to do. The photo used is very close
                        and in depth drawing you in. The colors used in the picture are similar to the website theme of
                        dark and light. </p>
