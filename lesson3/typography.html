        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>For the main logo I chose the typeface of League Script. This is a handwritten(decoration) typeface. I wanted
            to
            give it a modern yet sophisticated feeling. Many gardeners have an eye for design and are creative. This
            also is
            a beautiful yet easy to read typeface. It will be used in headings as well as the name of the website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The body san-seriff typeface called Monteserat to give good contrast. It is thin and rounded. It is also
            modern,
            clean, and simple looking which will add to the design overall. These two fonts together create a harmony of
            simplicity yet interest. These fonts are meant to be modern and appeal to the target audience of the
            website.
            This typeface will be used for the Navigation bar as well as the body and little text. </p>
